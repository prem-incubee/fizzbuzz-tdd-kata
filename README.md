Incubyte **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** Kata
================

This repository contains katas from [**Codurance**](https://www.codurance.com/katas) practiced using TDD approach.

About
-----

In this project, the solution is implemented using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, meaning the tests are written before the code, ensuring the solution is robust, correct, and maintainable.

Test-Driven Development Approach
------------

This project follows the 3 Laws of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach:

1.  Write no production code except to pass a failing test.
2.  Write only enough of a test to demonstrate a failure. (Not compiling is also a valid failure.)
3.  Write only enough production code to pass the test.

Once the test is passing, the code is refactored for clarity and efficiency.
The tests ensure that the implementation behaves as expected.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   [**Typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): The primary programming language used to implement the solution.
-   [**Vite**](https://vite.dev/): Vite is a blazing fast frontend build tool powering the next generation of web applications.
-   [**Jest with React Testing Library**](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro): The testing framework used to write unit tests for the katas.

How to Run the Tests
--------------------

Follow these steps to run the tests on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:prem-incubee/tdd-katas.git
    cd tdd-katas
    ```
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`

3. Run the Tests: `npm run test`
